# Dr. Cumbie’s Communication Policy: Online/Written

## Online & Written Communication: Canvas Inbox & Portal Email

The purpose of this course policy is to promote efficient and effective communication between the student and the professor so that I may be of better service to you. With a myriad of responsibilities from teaching, advising, and administration; a variety of courses from undergraduate to graduate, traditional and online, in Florence and in Asia, I always am juggling many open issues. Following these rules will not only help me to serve you but also teaches you to communicate in a professional manner. 
*Note: This is Dr. Cumbie’s Policy and does not reflect policies of UNA or the College of Business*

### Communication Methods
* Canvas Inbox is the primary, preferred, and official channel for communication in the course. 
* UNA Portal Email is reserved for extenuating circumstances. I will take longer to reply to a message via Portal.  

**_Communication Response Time_**
* I strive to respond promptly with a maximum turnaround time of two business days. 
* Refer to Communication Rule 08 below. 
* Messages that do not adhere to this policy may be ignored or asked to “Revise and resend according to the Course Communication Policy.”
* Last minute messages, right before a deadline, are likely to not get a helpful response in time. Try to tackle tasks early to troubleshoot early and allow enough time for questions and answers.  

**_Submission Comments_**
* Submission Comments or other forums in Canvas are not appropriate channels for communication.
* Submission Comments are suitable for only your initial comments upon submission, not ongoing conversations.
* I read your submission comments when I grade assignments.
* I may make comments regarding your submission while grading.
* However, if you reply to my comments, I do not have my notifications set nor do I check back for replies. 
* If you need to reply to my comments, then initiate a new message via Canvas Inbox.

### 01. Be Correct. Use correct grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and spelling.
* Whether sending from the Canvas App or a web browser, always strive to write clearly and correctly. 
* You are in college and should compose messages accordingly. 
* Avoid overuse of text abbreviations. 	
* Recommend installing the free versions of [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) or similar.
* For common mistakes, [Grammar Girl](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/grammar-girl) is a good resources, e.g., “affect vs. effect,” punctuation inside or outside a quotation. 

### 02. Say Hello. Begin new messages with a greeting.
* Examples:
    * “Good morning, Dr. Cumbie,”
    * “Hello Professor” 
* Avoid: “Hey” 
* Replies to ongoing conversations do not require an additional greeting each time. 
* Address UNA faculty and staff by their proper titles. Use [UNA’s directory](https://www.una.edu/directory/#/) to quickly look up and see. When in doubt to use “Dr.” or not, “Professor” is usually a safe alternative.
* You do not need to introduce yourself, Canvas Inbox is a closed-email platform
    * Your name and class are clearly identified by Canvas
    * Avoid: “My name is Milhous Van Houten and I am a student in your CIS 376 class.” 

### 03. Stay on Subject. New Issues = New Subjects.
* All messages require a brief and accurate subject line.
* If the topic is new, create a new message and use a descriptive subject. 
* Do not reply to a message with an unrelated topic. 
    * E.g.: I send a class message saying: “New Lecture Posted” and get a reply asking about the Mid-Term. 
* Do not start a new message for an ongoing thread; this keeps all the related detail in one place. 
	
### 04. Do not Bundle. One Issue per message.
* Limit messages to one topic.
* Send a separate message for an unrelated topic. 
* I would rather received three messages from a student with three different subjects pertaining to three separate issues than receiving a single, dense one. 

### 05. Be Direct.
* State your request directly, clearly, and upfront (immediately after your greeting). 
* Active voice is preferred over passive voice. Google it if you are unsure. 
* Good Examples:
    * Would you look over my Quiz 03 grade; I believe questions 3 and 7 were mistakenly counted wrong? 
    * May I have an extension on Project 04 to next Monday; I have a tournament with the UNA Golf Team? 
    * Can you explain how to submit a Google Doc with the correct sharing settings? 
* Bad Examples: 
    * I think my grade is wrong. (No request or question from you = no reply from me.)
    * I won’t be in class. (Thank-you but what do you want me to do about it?)
    * Forwarding an email with no additional message to me. 

### 06. Provide Evidence. I am not your detective.
* Immediately after stating your request, provide detail and support. 
* Present all requisite information and documentation to assist me in fulfilling your request. In other words, do not make me be a detective and hunt down the information. 
* The fewer pages I have to login to look up information for you, the slower my response. 
* Include references (textbook page no.), links, filename and line number for a coding question. 
* Screenshots are great, but if there is pertinent data I need (such as your LNo.) make sure to re-write it in your message.

* _Examples:_
    * An advisee seeking a course permit would include:  Student’s full name, LNo. Course Number and Title, Type of Permit (i.e., Program Restriction), and reason for the request. 
    * A student questioning an answer on a quiz would include: the assignment name/number, the question number, the question text, the student’s answer, the correct answer, and reference to course materials (e.g. lecture or page no.) that provides support for the claim 

### 07. Come with Solutions (not problems).

* Problems arise all the time and it is best practice to have a proposed solution ready when presenting a problem. 
* If you missed an assignment, 
    * Do not ask if I will still accept it to determine if you will bother to complete it. 
    * It is best to submit and say - “I know I messed up but would you consider reviewing it for some credit.” 
* List the steps you have taken so far.

### 08. Don’t Spam. Less is best.
* Please do not send duplicate messages via the same channel (i.e., 2+ in Canvas or one in Canvas, and the same in Portal and then a voicemail)
* Multiple messages slow down my process considerably.
* Allow two business days for a reply. If you have not received a reply, 
    * Reply to your original message (don’t resend) and kindly call my attention:  “Dr. Cumbie, have you had a chance to consider my request in the previous message?”
    * Review your message. Does it adhere to the communication policies such as including a subject line and with a specific request for me? If not, revise and re-send.  “Dr. Cumbie, I am re-sending a previous message with corrections and/or updates.” 

### 09. NRN. No Reply Needed.
* If I include, “NRN” then a reply to my message is not needed. 
* This avoids messages that just say “Thanks!” or similar.
* You may use NRN for messages to me if appropriate as well.  “Dr. Cumbie, I found the problem with my code and no longer need to drop by your office. NRN.”

*This is a new one (Spring 2019), so we will see how it goes. 

### 10. To whom are you referring?

* Avoid saying “the lady in the office over there told me I need your approval.” 
    * Better: “I spoke with Dr. So and So in the Geography department and she…”
* Take the time and care to know who you are speaking to & communicate that to me. 
* Use the [UNA Directory](https://www.una.edu/directory/#/) to help you out.
